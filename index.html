    <p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

    Some of my projects with a brief description can be found below.
        <p>
            <strong>Finance</strong><br>
            Finance is web-basedapplication via which users can buy and sell stocks.<br>
            Real-time prices of stocks were taken making use of an API.<br>
            Basic functionality included logging in, buying or selling stocks and maintaining history of previous transactions.<br>
            Implemented as a part of CS50 courseware.
